# Learning About AI Agents

## Learning Journey

This repo is part of my learning process on **AI agents**.  
I am following along with [this tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZzyPscbtI8&list=WL&index=64&t=1478s) to understand how to build and experiment with AI responses.

The goal is to practice:
- Working with AI agent frameworks
- Handling structured outputs (e.g., JSON with Pydantic models)
- Integrating AI responses into applications
- Building my first AI agent
